# UX Improvements - Authentication & Error Handling

## What Was Improved

### Problem
When users tried to upload files without being signed in, they would:
- See no visual feedback about authentication requirements
- Get a silent 401 error in the console
- Uploads would appear to work but creating transfers would fail
- No clear guidance on what to do next

### Solution Implemented

## 1. **Upload Page (`/new`) - Clear Authentication Status**

### Before Sign In:
- ⚠️ **Yellow warning banner** at top:
  - "Sign In Required"
  - Clear message: "You must be signed in to upload and share files"
  - Direct "Sign In Now →" button
- **Disabled buttons** (grayed out with cursor: not-allowed)
- **Tooltip on hover**: "Sign in to upload"

### After Sign In:
- ✅ **Green success banner** at top:
  - "Signed in as user@example.com"
  - Gives confidence that authentication is working

### During Auth Check:
- ⏳ **Blue loading banner**:
  - "Checking authentication..."
  - No confusion during page load

## 2. **Error Messages - Clear & Actionable**

### Global Error Display
- Red alert box at top of page
- Clear error icon (❌)
- Specific error messages:
  - "You must be signed in to create transfers"
  - "Session expired. Redirecting to sign in..."
  - "No files uploaded successfully. Please try again."

### Auto-Redirect
- When unauthorized, shows error for 2 seconds
- Then automatically redirects to sign-in page
- Preserves callback URL to return after sign-in

## 3. **Sign-In Page Enhancement**

### Redirect Context
- When coming from upload page:
  - Shows yellow banner: "⚠️ Please sign in to continue"
  - User understands why they were redirected

### After Sign-In
- Automatically returns to upload page (`/new`)
- User can continue their workflow seamlessly

## 4. **Button States**

### Upload All Button
- **Enabled** (Blue): When authenticated and ready
- **Disabled** (Gray): When not authenticated
- **Loading** (Blue, 60% opacity): "Uploading..."

### Create Transfer Button
- **Enabled** (Green): When authenticated and files uploaded
- **Disabled** (Gray): When not authenticated
- Shows tooltip on hover when disabled

```

5. Sees "✓ Signed in as user@example.com"
6. Selects files
