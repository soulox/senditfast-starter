## 🐛 Bug Fixes

1. **UUID vs Slug Error:**
   - Fixed: Share page now uses transfer `id` (UUID) instead of `slug` for notifications
   - Error was: `invalid input syntax for type uuid: "udKb5hH26mCW41YtcujfMg"`

2. **Localhost in Production:**
   - Fixed: All email links now use production domain
   - No more localhost links in emails sent from production server

   - Added: Filters out invalid emails (must contain `@`)
   - Added: Check for empty email list
