```

**Restart your server:**
```bash
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
pnpm dev:https
```

**Test Google Sign-In:**
1. Go to `https://localhost:3000/auth/signin`
2. Click "Sign in with Google"
3. Should work without OAuth policy error!

## ðŸ“‹ **Complete Redirect URIs List**

For local development (HTTPS):
```
https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
```

For production (when deployed):
```
https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google
```

**Note:** You can have both local and production URIs configured at the same time.

## ðŸ”’ **Security Notes**

- HTTPS is required for OAuth in production
- Self-signed certificates work for local development
- Google requires HTTPS for security
- Never commit your `.env.local` file

## âœ… **You're All Set!**

Once you update the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console:
- Google Sign-In will work
- No more OAuth policy errors
- Users can sign in with Google seamlessly

The HTTPS server is running at `https://localhost:3000` with the correct configuration!
