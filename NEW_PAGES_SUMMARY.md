## 📁 **Folder Upload Feature**

### **What's New:**
- ✅ Drag & drop entire folders
- ✅ Browse and select folders via button
- ✅ Preserves folder structure in file names
- ✅ Recursive folder processing
- ✅ Works with nested folders

### **How It Works:**

**Drag & Drop:**
- Drag a folder from your file explorer
- Drop it into the upload zone
- All files in the folder (including subfolders) are added
- Folder structure is preserved in file names

**Browse Folders Button:**
- Click "📁 Browse Folders"
- Select a folder
- All files are automatically added
- Maintains folder hierarchy

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `webkitGetAsEntry()` API for drag & drop
- Uses `webkitdirectory` attribute for folder selection
- Recursive processing of directory entries
- Preserves full path in file names (e.g., `folder/subfolder/file.pdf`)

### **UI Updates:**
- New "📁 Browse Folders" button
- Updated drop zone text: "Drop files or folders here"
- Two-button layout: "📄 Browse Files" and "📁 Browse Folders"
- Gradient styling for better UX
