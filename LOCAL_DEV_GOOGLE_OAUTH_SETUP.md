# ‚úÖ Google OAuth HTTPS Setup - Complete

## üéâ What Has Been Configured

### ‚úÖ 1. SSL Certificates Generated
- Self-signed certificates created in `.ssl/` directory
- Files created:
  - `.ssl/localhost.crt`
  - `.ssl/localhost.key`

### ‚úÖ 2. Environment Variables Updated
Your `.env.local` now uses HTTPS:
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://localhost:3000
```

### ‚úÖ 3. HTTPS Server Running
- Server is running at: **https://localhost:3000**
- Using Node.js HTTPS server with self-signed certificates

---

## üîß NEXT STEPS - Required Actions

### Step 1: Accept Self-Signed Certificate in Browser

1. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   https://localhost:3000/auth/signup
   ```

2. **You'll see a security warning** - This is normal for self-signed certificates

3. **Click "Advanced"** (or similar button)

4. **Click "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"** or "Accept the Risk and Continue"

5. **The page should load** - you'll see the sign-up form

---

### Step 2: Update Google Cloud Console

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** You must add the HTTPS redirect URI to Google Cloud Console

1. **Go to:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

2. **Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID:**
   - Client ID: `851721349401-qm6lipfcf6dfccuajkaumnt48lt943f8.apps.googleusercontent.com`

3. **Click the edit icon (pencil)**

4. **Scroll to "Authorized redirect URIs"**

5. **Click "+ ADD URI"**

6. **Add this EXACT URI:**
   ```
   https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
   ```

7. **Keep your production URI:**
   ```
   https://senditfast.net/api/auth/callback/google
   ```

8. **Click "SAVE"**

9. **Wait 5-10 seconds** for changes to propagate

---

### Step 3: Test Google Sign-Up

1. **Navigate to:** https://localhost:3000/auth/signup

2. **Click "Sign up with Google"**

3. **You should be redirected to Google's sign-in page**

4. **Sign in with your Google account**

5. **You should be redirected back to:** https://localhost:3000/dashboard

‚úÖ If successful, you're all set!

## üöÄ Server Commands

### Start HTTPS Server (for development)
```bash
npm run dev:https
```

### Start Regular HTTP Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Regenerate SSL Certificates (if needed)
```bash
npm run ssl:generate
```

---

## üìù Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `.env.local` - Updated URLs to HTTPS
- ‚úÖ `.ssl/localhost.crt` - Generated SSL certificate
- ‚úÖ `.ssl/localhost.key` - Generated SSL private key
- ‚úÖ `.env.local.backup` - Backup of original config

---

## üêõ Debugging - Issue Found

### Original Problem:
The Google sign-up button **was working correctly**, but there were two configuration issues:

1. ‚ùå **Environment was set to production URLs** (`https://senditfast.net`)
   - ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Now uses `https://localhost:3000`

2. ‚ùå **Google OAuth requires HTTPS**, not HTTP
   - ‚úÖ **Fixed:** Generated SSL certificates and configured HTTPS server

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Google Cloud Console redirect URI missing**
   - üîß **Needs your action:** Add `https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

### Error Details:
- **Error Code:** `redirect_uri_mismatch` (Error 400)
- **Reason:** The redirect URI wasn't registered in Google Cloud Console
- **Solution:** Follow Step 2 above to add it

---

## üîê Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Self-signed certificates are for development only!**
- Your browser will show warnings - this is expected
- **Never use self-signed certificates in production**
- For production, use proper SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- ‚úÖ SSL certificates generated
- ‚úÖ Environment variables updated to HTTPS
- ‚úÖ HTTPS server running on port 3000
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO: Add redirect URI to Google Cloud Console**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO: Accept browser security warning**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO: Test Google sign-up flow**

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Server not starting?
```bash
# Kill any processes on port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /F /PID <PID>

# Restart HTTPS server
npm run dev:https
```

### Certificate errors?
```bash
# Regenerate certificates
npm run ssl:generate

# Restart server
npm run dev:https
```

### Still getting redirect_uri_mismatch?
- Double-check the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure it's EXACTLY: `https://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- Wait 5-10 seconds after saving for changes to propagate
- Clear your browser cache and cookies for localhost

---

## üéØ Summary

Your Google OAuth setup is now configured for HTTPS local development. Once you:

1. Accept the browser security warning for the self-signed certificate
2. Add the HTTPS redirect URI to Google Cloud Console

...your Google sign-up will work perfectly! üéâ
