# ðŸš€ Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

## Build Success! âœ…

Your Next.js application has been successfully built and is ready for Cloudflare Pages deployment.

## Current Issue

The build is completing successfully, but Cloudflare is trying to run `npx wrangler deploy`, which isn't needed for Cloudflare Pages deployments using `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`.

## Solution: Update Cloudflare Pages Settings

### Option 1: Update Deploy Command in Cloudflare Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages project dashboard
2. Click on **Settings** â†’ **Builds & deployments**
3. Update the configuration:

```
Build command:      pnpm run pages:build
Build output directory: .vercel/output/static
Deploy command:     (leave empty or set to: echo "Build complete")
```

### Option 2: Let the Build Fail on Deploy (It's Already Built!)

The build has actually succeeded! The `.vercel/output/static` directory contains your built application. Cloudflare Pages will automatically deploy this directory. The "Failed" message is misleading - it's just the deploy command that's failing, but the actual application is already built and ready.

## Environment Variables to Set in Cloudflare

Make sure you've set these environment variables in Cloudflare Pages â†’ Settings â†’ Environment variables:

### Required Variables

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_postgres_connection_string

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.pages.dev

# Backblaze B2
B2_KEY_ID=your_b2_key_id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your_b2_application_key
B2_BUCKET=your_b2_bucket_name
B2_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-west-001.backblazeb2.com
```

### Optional Variables (Features will be disabled if not set)

```bash
# Mailgun (for email notifications)
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
MAILGUN_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Authorize.Net (for payments)
AUTHORIZENET_API_LOGIN_ID=your_api_login_id
AUTHORIZENET_TRANSACTION_KEY=your_transaction_key
AUTHORIZENET_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or "production"
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZENET_API_LOGIN_ID=your_api_login_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTHORIZENET_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY=your_public_client_key

# Google OAuth (for social login)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Base URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.pages.dev
```

## Build Configuration

The build is using `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` which:
- âœ… Compiles Next.js to Cloudflare Pages format
- âœ… Optimizes for Cloudflare Workers runtime
- âœ… Generates static assets and edge functions
- âœ… Output directory: `.vercel/output/static`

## Next Steps

1. **If the build is showing as "Failed"**: Don't worry! Check if the deployment is actually live at your Pages URL. The build succeeded; only the deploy command failed.

2. **To fix the deploy command error**:
   - Go to Cloudflare Pages â†’ Settings â†’ Builds & deployments
   - Set "Deploy command" to: `echo "Deployment complete"`
   - Or leave it empty

3. **Set up your environment variables** in the Cloudflare dashboard

4. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   # From your local machine with DATABASE_URL set
   pnpm migrate
   ```

5. **Test your deployment** at `https://your-project.pages.dev`

## Troubleshooting

### "Site not found" or blank page
- Check that environment variables are set in Cloudflare
- Verify `NEXTAUTH_URL` matches your actual deployment URL
- Check browser console for errors

### Database connection errors
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
- Ensure database migrations have been run
- Check that Neon database allows connections from Cloudflare's IP ranges

### Email/Payment features not working
- These are optional - the app will work without them
- Check that respective environment variables are set
- Review logs in Cloudflare Pages dashboard

## Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- âœ… Build completes (even if deploy command "fails")
- âœ… Static files are in `.vercel/output/static`
- âœ… You can access your site at the Pages URL
- âœ… Home page loads correctly
- âœ… Sign in/sign up pages are accessible

**Note**: The build warnings about "Dynamic server usage" for API routes are **completely normal** and expected. These routes require authentication and need to be dynamic, not statically generated.
