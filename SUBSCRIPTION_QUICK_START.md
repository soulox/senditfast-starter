## FAQ

**Q: Who charges the customer monthly?**

A: Yes! They go to `/subscription` and click "Cancel Subscription."

**Q: Do I need to write cron jobs?**  
A: No! Authorize.NET handles everything. You just process webhooks.

**Q: How do I change pricing?**  
A: Update the amounts in `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts` (line 60).
