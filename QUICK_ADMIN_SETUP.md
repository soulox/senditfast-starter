# 🚀 Quick Super Admin Setup

## ✅ What Was Built

A comprehensive Super Admin Control Panel with:

- **User Management** - View, edit, delete users with search/filter
- **Plan Management** - Change user plans (FREE/PRO/BUSINESS)  
- **Analytics Dashboard** - Real-time stats and usage monitoring
- **Audit Logging** - Track all admin actions
- **Role-Based Access** - SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, USER roles
- **Security** - Separate auth layer, permissions, action logging

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f infra/sql/add-super-admin.sql
```

This adds:
- `role` column to users
- `admin_audit_log` table
- `user_usage_stats` table  
- Analytics views and triggers

### 2. Promote Yourself to Super Admin

```sql
-- Replace with your email
UPDATE app_user 
SET role = 'SUPER_ADMIN' 
WHERE email = 'youremail@example.com';
```

### 3. Access the Panel

Navigate to:
```
https://senditfast.net/superadmin
```

**That's it!** 🎉

## 🌐 Optional: Subdomain Setup

For extra security, host on `admin.senditfast.net`:

### Cloudflare DNS
```
Type: CNAME
Name: admin  
Content: senditfast.net
Proxy: Enabled
```

### Nginx Config
```nginx
server {
    server_name admin.senditfast.net;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/superadmin;
    }
}
```

See `SUPER_ADMIN_SETUP.md` for complete subdomain configuration.
